# Student Performance Prediction

> Machine learning model to predict student math scores based on demographic and educational factors

# Project Overview

This AI Bootcamp final project develops a machine learning solution to predict student mathematics performance. Using a dataset of 1,000 student records, with Linear Regression.

# Key Features
- Predicts math scores based on 7 input features
- Comprehensive data analysis and visualization
- Educational insights for stakeholders

# Dataset

Source: [Kaggle - Students Performance in Exams](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/spscientist/students-performance-in-exams)

| Feature | Type | Description |
|---------|------|-------------|
| Gender | Categorical | Male/Female |
| Race/Ethnicity | Categorical | Group A-E |
| Parental Education | Categorical | Education level |
| Lunch | Categorical | Standard/Free-Reduced |
| Test Preparation | Categorical | Completed/None |
| Reading Score | Numerical | 0-100 |
| Writing Score | Numerical | 0-100 |
| Math Score | Target | 0-100 |

# Key Insights

- Reading & Writing scores are strongest predictors of math performance
- Standard lunch students outperform free/reduced lunch by 10-15 points
- Test preparation provides consistent 5-8 point improvement
- Female students perform better overall, males have slight math advantage
- Strong subject correlations (0.8+) across all test scores

# Usage Example

# Load and preprocess data
df = pd.read_csv('Students.csv')
X = df.drop('math_score', axis=1)
y = df['math_score']

# Train model
model = LinearRegression()
model.fit(X_processed, y)

# Make prediction
prediction = model.predict(new_student_data)
print(f"Predicted Math Score: {prediction[0]:.1f}")
